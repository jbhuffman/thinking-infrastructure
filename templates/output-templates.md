## LinkedIn Post Template (Professional, Personal)

Opening:
- One grounded observation or experience
- Avoid hype or announcements

Body:
- 2–4 short paragraphs
- One clear point
- Personal insight or earned opinion

Close:
- Soft invitation
- No pitch

Example:
Opening: Lately I have been thinking about how much unnecessary urgency we create.
Body: Most problems are solvable with patience, clarity, and ownership. The chaos usually comes from pretending everything is critical.
Close: If this resonates, always open to comparing notes.

## LinkedIn Post Template (Professional, Personal – Reflective)

Use When:
- The point is uncertainty, tension, or critique
- You are naming a discomfort, not solving it
- Advice would weaken the message
- Resolution would feel dishonest

Opening:
- A blunt observation or friction point

Body:
- Personal reflection
- Why the common advice does not sit right
- What feels misaligned or performative

Close:
- Open-ended question or statement
- No checklist
- No CTA beyond curiosity

Rule:
Do not pivot into tips, frameworks, or how-to content unless explicitly asked.

## LinkedIn Post Template (Business Page)

Opening:
- Client-facing insight
- Problem framed plainly

Body:
- What usually goes wrong
- What works better
- Why it matters

Close:
- Clear but calm CTA

Example:
Opening: Many integrations fail for boring reasons.
Body: Unclear ownership, vague contracts, and assumptions that never get revisited. The fix is rarely exotic.
Close: If this is a problem you are navigating, happy to talk.

Brand Signature:
- Always include the company slogan as the final line
- Visually separated from the post body
- Styled with light “bling” but not salesy
- Never framed as a CTA

Format:
✨ Smart logic for modern platforms ✨

## Resume Bullet Template

Format:
- Action verb + scope
- What changed or improved
- Why it mattered

Example:
Led integration platform redesign, reducing failure rates and simplifying onboarding for downstream systems.

Rules:
- One sentence
- No buzzwords
- Results over responsibilities

---

## Architecture Explanation Template (Non-Technical Audience)

Opening:
- What the system does
- Why it exists

Middle:
- How it fits into the larger picture
- Key tradeoffs made

Close:
- What it enables now
- What it allows later

Example:
This service exists to make data movement predictable. We traded flexibility for clarity, which reduced errors and made failures easier to diagnose.

---

## Architecture Explanation Template (Technical Audience)

Opening:
- Problem statement
- Constraints

Body:
- Chosen approach
- Alternatives considered
- Tradeoffs

Close:
- Known risks
- Revisit triggers

Rules:
- Explicit assumptions
- No hand-waving
- Document decisions, not just outcomes

---

## Client Update Template

Opening:
- Status in one sentence

Body:
- What was completed
- What is next
- Risks or decisions needed

Close:
- Clear ask, if any

Example:
This week we finalized the data mapping layer. Next up is validation and error handling. The only open risk is upstream payload consistency.

---

## Decision Rationale Template

Opening:
- Decision made

Body:
- Why this option
- What was rejected and why

Close:
- When to revisit

Example:
We chose a managed service to reduce operational overhead. Self-hosting was rejected due to maintenance cost. Revisit if usage patterns change materially.

---

## Personal Boundary Statement Template

Purpose:
Used when setting expectations with clients, teams, or employers.

Structure:
- Boundary
- Rationale
- Reassurance

Example:
I do not work weekends except for true emergencies. This keeps delivery predictable and quality high.

---

## Default Editing Checklist
Before finalizing any output:
- Can this be shorter?
- Is the point obvious on a skim?
- Did I say the thing directly?
- Is the tone calm and confident?

If yes, ship it.
